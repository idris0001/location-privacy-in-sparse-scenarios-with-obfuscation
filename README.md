# location-privacy-in-sparse-scenarios-with-obfuscation
Following the existing issues associated with location privacy in the Vehicular Adhoc Network in the sparse scenarios e,g in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10065527, authors are making attempts to come up with great solutions in this domain. We attempt using in this work, an obfuscation technique to help resolve this challenge
Software tools required: Crypto++, ns-3, SUMO, and OpenStreetMap
